<br /><h3>Status of the Fishery (as of 07/12/2004)</h3><p>
Lac La Croix is in Ecological Lake Class 2, which
consists of 15 lakes in northeast Minnesota that
are very large, have very irregular shoreline
shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.
With a surface area of 34,070 acres, maximum depth
of 168 ft, littoral area of about 25 percent,
total alkalinity of 12-16 ppm, Secchi water
clarity of 8 ft on the east end and 15 ft on the
west end, and a Shoreline Development Factor of
about 7.1, Lac La Croix is very typical of lakes
in this lake class.
<P>
Lac La Croix was thermally stratified on
07/12/2004 with surface temperatures about 73 F
and bottom temperatures about 43 F.  On the west
end of the lake, 7.0 ppm oxygen was retained to a
depth of 100 ft (the length of the sampling probe
cable) over a bottom depth of 120 ft at WQ-1 and
9.0 ppm oxygen was retained to a depth of 100 ft
over a bottom depth of 106 ft at WQ-2.  On the
east end of the lake, 6.9 ppm oxygen was retained
to the bottom depth of 130 ft at WQ-3, and 7.5 ppm
oxygen was retained to the bottom depth of 120 ft.
On both ends of the lake, the depth at which the
water temperature was good for trout (55 F) was
about 35 ft.
<P>
Lac La Croix is a very rocky lake with little
aquatic vegetation present.  The major inlets are
the Basswood River and the Maligne River, entering
at several points along the east end of the lake,
and the outlets are the Namakan River and the Loon
River, exiting on the north and west ends of the
lake, respectively.
<P>
This fish population assessment consisted of 12
shallow gillnets set in depths of 8-26 ft where
water temperatures were warmer than 55 F, 29 deep
gillnets set in depths of 43-124 ft where the
water temperatures were colder than 55 F, and 8
smelt nets set in depths of 54-100 ft.  The
shallow and deep gillnets used were standard
Minnesota survey gillnets 6' x 250' with five 50'
panels, one panel each of 0.75", 1.0", 1.25",
1.5", and 2.0" bar mesh twisted nylon, graduated
from smallest to largest mesh.  The smelt nets
were 6' x 200' with two 100' panels, one panel
each of 0.375" and 0.5" bar mesh twisted nylon.
Approximately equal numbers of nets were set on
each end of the lake, with the large shallow
central basin between Twentyfive Island and
Twentyseven Island being the dividing line between
the east and west ends.
<P>
Because of the stratified sampling (separate deep
and shallow gillnets) used in this assessment, the
CPUE quartiles developed for standard gillnet
sampling for this lake class cannot be used as a
basis for comparison and are omitted from this
report.  Standard sampling consists of gillnets
set from shallow to deeper water, with the entire
net set in oxygenated water, but with variable
amounts of net sampling shallow (warm) and deep
(cold) water.  In general, warm water is probably
sampled more intensively than cold water with
standard sampling because the species of interest
are warm water game fish.  With stratified
sampling, cold water is often sampled more
intensively than warm water because the species of
interest is usually lake trout.
<P>
Previous Minnesota DNR Investigations were
conducted in 1963 (shallow nets only -
cooperatively with Ontario MNR), in 1984 (shallow
and deep gillnets - Minnesota DNR only), and in
1994 (shallow, deep, and smelt gillnets,
cooperatively with Ontario MNR).
<P>
<P>
<P>
SHALLOW GILLNETS:
<P>
For Lac La Croix as a whole, the total catch of
fish (all species combined) in the shallow
gillnets in 2004 of 12 fish/net (27 lb/net) was
similar to catches in 1984, 1994, and 1999, but
was lower than the catch in 1963.  More walleye
and white sucker were caught in 1963 than in later
investigations:

<P>
Shallow water fish populations in 2004 were very
similar on the east end of the lake in 2004 (13
fish/net, 26 lb/net) and on the west end of the
lake (12 fish/net, 28 lb/net).  In general,
gillnet catches of shallow water fish on both ends
of the lake were dominated by walleye and northern
pike.
<P>
For Lac La Croix as a whole, walleye catches
appeared to gradually decline, from a high of
14/net in 1963 to a low of 5.5/net in 2004.  Net
locations and depths were not recorded in the 1963
investigation, so we cannot separate catches from
the east and west ends of the lake in that
investigation.
<P>
Walleye numbers in the east end of the lake in
2004 (5.8/net) were similar to the median catch of
6.5/net in all four shallow water investigations
in which east end catches were kept separate,
beginning in 1984.  East end walleye sizes in 2004
averaged 15.5", which was larger than the average
size of 13.7" in all investigations on the east
end of this lake.  The largest walleye on the east
end was 24.4" (all fish lengths in this report are
total lengths).  Walleye aged two through seven
were captured in 2004 with no particular year
class being dominant.  Walleye growth was slower
than normal (in the first or second quartile,
depending on the age) by area standards.  Twenty
nine of 33 walleye stomachs examined were empty,
the remaining stomachs contained cisco (2) or
yellow perch (2).   No smelt were found in walleye
stomachs on the east end of the lake.
<P>
Walleye numbers in the west end of the lake in
2004 (5.2/net) were lower than previous catches of
8.3/net in 1984, 17.3/net in 1994, and 7.0/net in
1999.  West end walleye sizes in 2004 averaged
15.8", which was larger than the average size of
14.6" in all investigations on the west end of
this lake.  The largest walleye on the west end
was 23.7".   Most of the walleye were age two (20
%) and age three (42 %).  Walleye growth was
somewhat faster than normal (in the third
quartile) by area standards.  Twenty five of 30
walleye stomachs examined were empty, the
remaining stomachs contained smelt (5).
<P>
The proportion of walleye greater than 500 mm fork
length is used by Ontario as an indicator of fish
size quality.  Using the conversion Total Length =
Fork Length x 1.06 and converting to English units
results in a quality size of 20.7".  Using this
criterion, walleye of quality size in the 2004
catch were few, but were more abundant than in
past assessments (numbers of fish in parenthesis):

Gillnet catches of northern pike in Lac La Croix
have been remarkably consistent over time, ranging
from 3.1gillnet in 1984 to 4.6/net in 1963.  The
2004 pike catch of 3.7/net falls in the middle of
this historic range.  Similar numbers of pike were
captured in the east and west ends of the lake in
2004 as in previous investigations.  Pike sizes in
2004 averaged 25" (3.6 lbs) and were similar in
the east and west basins, but were somewhat larger
than the average size of 23" in all investigations
on this lake.   The largest pike, caught on the
east end, was 39".  Pike scales were difficult to
read, but pike from ages two through seven were
present and pike growth appeared to be faster than
normal by area standards.
<P>
In summary, shallow water fish populations in 2004
were dominated by walleye and northern pike:
<P>
Walleye numbers have been stable on the east end
of the lake over time, but have declined on the
west end, and in 2004 similar numbers of walleye
were captured on each end of the lake.  Walleye
sizes historically have been somewhat larger on
the west end of the lake, but in 2004 walleye
sizes were similar on each end of the lake.  The
average age of walleye captured on the west end of
the lake was younger than on the east end of the
lake.  Walleye growth was faster on the west end
of the lake, and some walleye stomachs contained
smelt.  Male walleye matured earlier on the west
end of the lake.
<P>
Pike numbers have been quite consistent over time
and have been similar on each end of the lake.
The average size of northern pike in 2004 and
previous investigations was somewhat larger on the
west end of the lake.  Growth of pike captured in
2004 appeared to be similar on each end of the
lake, although pike scales were difficult to read.
<P>
<P>
DEEP GILLNETS:
<P>
For Lac La Croix as a whole, the total catch of
fish (all species combined) in the deep gillnets
in 2004 of 19 fish/net was lower than catches in
1984, but was similar to catches in 1994 and 1999:
<P>

<P>
Deep water fish populations were higher on the
east end of the lake in 2004 (29 fish/net, 26
lb/net) than on the west end (7 fish/net, 14
lb/net), due mostly to higher numbers of cisco on
the east end.  In general, deep water fish
populations on the east end were dominated by
cisco, lake whitefish, and lake trout, while fish
populations on the west end were dominated by
smelt (reported in the following section), lake
whitefish, and lake trout.
<P>
Cisco numbers on the east end of the lake in 2004
(25.9/net) were similar to previous catches on
this end of the lake, which ranged from 22.6/net
to 25.9/net.  East end cisco sizes in 2004
averaged 9.4"; the largest was 18.2".
<P>
Cisco numbers on the west end of the lake in 2004
(1.2/net) were similar to the catch of 0.8/net in
1994 and 0.9/net in 1999, but were much lower than
the catch of 35.3/net in 1984.  West end cisco
sizes in 2004 averaged 8.8"; the largest was
14.1".
<P>
Lake whitefish numbers on the east end of the lake
in 2004 (1.6/net) were lower than previous
catches, which ranged from 4.0/net to 7.6/net.
East end whitefish sizes in 2004 averaged 16.6";
the largest was 23.4".
<P>
Lake whitefish numbers on the west end of the lake
in 2004 (3.5/net) were similar to previous
catches, which ranged from 2.2/net to 3.5/net.
West end whitefish sizes in 2004 averaged 15.9";
the largest was 23.3".
<P>
Lake trout numbers on the east end of the lake in
2004 (1.1/net) were similar to previous catches,
which ranged from 0.7/net to 1.4/net.  East end
trout sizes in 2004 averaged 29.6"; the largest
was 37.6".   Historically, most trout captured in
the east end of the lake have been 20" or larger,
the exception being in 1999 when 10 of 21 trout
were smaller than 20".  Five of six trout stomachs
examined in 2004 contained cisco, and one stomach
was empty.  Ages of the eight lake trout killed
from the east end of the lake in 2004 ranged from
6 to 23, based on otolith readings.
<P>
Lake trout numbers on the west end of the lake
(0.7/net) were lower than previous catches of
2.7/net in 1984 and 3.0/net in 1994, but were
identical to the catch of 0.7/net in 1999. West
end trout sizes in 2004 averaged 25.2"; the
largest was 35.0".  In contrast to assessments in
1984 and 1994 when many of the captured trout were
under 20", only one of nine trout captured on the
west end in 1999 was less than 20" and no trout in
2004 was under 20".  Three of five trout stomachs
examined in 2004 were empty, while two stomachs
contained smelt.  Ages of the five trout killed
from the west end of the lake in 2004 were 6 (two
trout) and 7 (three trout).  Although sample sizes
were small and there was little age overlap, it
appears that trout from the west end of the lake
were growing faster than on the east end.
<P>
Burbot numbers have declined in each end of the
lake over time, and their numbers in 2004 were
quite low: 0.1/net on the east end and 0.7 on the
west end.
<P>
<P>
DEEP SMELT GILLNETS:
<P>
Smelt were not captured or observed in game fish
stomachs during the 1984 assessment.  Smelt were
first captured in Lac La Croix in 1989, south of
Snow Bay, by a University of North Dakota crew
specifically looking for smelt.
<P>
Smelt nets set in 2004, as in 1999 and 1994,
captured smelt in the west end of the lake as far
east as net 56, about one mile southwest of
Twentyfive Island.  Smelt numbers in the five
westernmost smelt nets in 2004 (including net 56,
the westernmost of the eastern smelt nets),
averaged 20.0/net, which was lower than the 1999
average catch of 73.8/net and the 1994 average
catch of 38.5/net in these same five nets.  As in
1994 and 1999, all but a few of the smelt captured
in 2004 were in the 0.375" bar mesh, except that
the easternmost net had about half of the smelt in
the 0.5" mesh.  Smelt sizes in 2004 averaged 4.9";
the largest was 6.7".
<P>
Smelt were found in the stomach of a lake trout in
the bay west of Fish Stake Narrows in 2004.
Previously, the farthest east smelt had been
observed in Minnesota waters of Lac La Croix were
in a lake trout stomach four miles south of
Twentyfive Island in 1999.
<P>
East end cisco numbers in the 2004 smelt nets
(57.2/net) were similar to the 1999 catch of
60.8/net, and were higher than the 1994 catch of
16.5/net.   Most cisco were in the 0.5" bar mesh,
and east end cisco sizes in the smelt nets
averaged 5.7".
<P>
West end cisco numbers in the 2004 smelt nets
(3.5/net) were similar to the 1999 catch of
4.2/net and were higher than in 1994, when no
cisco were captured in the west end.  All the
cisco in 2004 were in the 0.5" bar mesh, and west
end cisco sizes in the smelt nets averaged 5.5".
<P>
In summary, deep water fish populations are
dominated by cisco, whitefish, and lake trout in
the east end of the lake, and by smelt, whitefish,
and lake trout in the west end of the lake.  Smelt
and cisco populations overlap in the vicinity of
Twentyfive Island.  Smelt were observed as far
east as the bay west of Fish Stake Narrows, which
is the farthest eastern observance to date.  Lake
trout catches have declined in the west end of the
lake and were similar to east end catches in 1999
and 2004.  Few small lake trout (less than 20")
were captured in 2004, and all lake trout were age
six years old or older.  Lake trout on the west
end are eating smelt and growing faster.  The
apparent lack of recruitment of cisco (and perhaps
lake trout) in the west end of the lake and the
faster growth of walleye and lake trout in the
west end of the lake is consistent with the
responses to smelt introductions reported
elsewhere.
